# Journal
A daily journal (front-end) for logging information about the day and planning out a selected day.

## User Account Management

Currently a user can sign up or log in to the app, although neither actually do anything due to the backend code not being implemented. So, there is no stored data to be accessed and this app acts as only a front-end visual concept.

## Views

There are multiple traversable views for properly entering and viewing daily data.

### Calendar View

A basic page with a calendar used to select the desired day for data entry and/or planning.

### Day View

A page for entering daily information and/or planning out the day. The support data entry methods currently supported are:user c
* Steps - track daily steps
* Water - track daily water intake by ounces or bottles
* Calories - displays total daily calory intake based on recorded daily food items
* To Do List - user can manage a list of to do items, with checkboxes to track completion
* Workout - user can manage a dynamic list of exercises
* Food - track daily food intake
* Notes - for general notes about the day

Also, the user can return to the calendar view and switch the day that is being viewed within the day view.
